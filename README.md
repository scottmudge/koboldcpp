# koboldcpp

KoboldCpp is an easy-to-use AI text-generation software for GGML and GGUF models. It's a single self contained distributable from Concedo, that builds off llama.cpp, and adds a versatile Kobold API endpoint, additional format support, Stable Diffusion image generation, backward compatibility, as well as a fancy UI with persistent stories, editing tools, save formats, memory, world info, author's note, characters, scenarios and everything Kobold and Kobold Lite have to offer.

## Windows Usage
- **[Download the latest .exe release here](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases/latest)** or clone the git repo.
- Windows binaries are provided in the form of **koboldcpp.exe**, which is a pyinstaller wrapper for a few **.dll** files and **koboldcpp.py**. You can also rebuild it yourself with the provided makefiles and scripts.
- Weights are not included, you can use the official llama.cpp `quantize.exe` to generate them from your official weight files (or download them from other places such as [TheBloke's Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke).
- To run, simply execute **koboldcpp.exe**.
- Launching with no command line arguments displays a GUI containing a subset of configurable settings. Generally you dont have to change much besides the `Presets` and `GPU Layers`. Read the `--help` for more info about each settings.
- By default, you can connect to http://localhost:5001
- You can also run it using the command line. For info, please check `koboldcpp.exe --help`

### Improving Performance
- **(Nvidia Only) GPU Acceleration**: If you're on Windows with an Nvidia GPU you can get CUDA support out of the box using the `--usecublas` flag, make sure you select the correct .exe with CUDA support.
- **Any GPU Acceleration**: As a slightly slower alternative, try CLBlast with `--useclblast` flags for a slightly slower but more GPU compatible speedup.
- **GPU Layer Offloading**: Want even more speedup? Combine one of the above GPU flags with `--gpulayers` to offload entire layers to the GPU! **Much faster, but uses more VRAM**. Experiment to determine number of layers to offload, and reduce by a few if you run out of memory.
- **Increasing Context Size**: Try `--contextsize 4096` to 2x your context size! without much perplexity gain. Note that you'll have to increase the max context in the Kobold Lite UI as well (click and edit the number text field).
- If you are having crashes or issues, you can try turning off BLAS with the `--noblas` flag. You can also try running in a non-avx2 compatibility mode with `--noavx2`. Lastly, you can try turning off mmap with `--nommap`.

For more information, be sure to run the program with the `--help` flag, or [check the wiki](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki).

## Run on Colab
- KoboldCpp now has an **official Colab GPU Notebook**! This is an easy way to get started without installing anything in a minute or two. [Try it here!](https://colab.research.google.com/github/LostRuins/koboldcpp/blob/concedo/colab.ipynb).
- Note that KoboldCpp is not responsible for your usage of this Colab Notebook, you should ensure that your own usage complies with Google Colab's terms of use.

## OSX and Linux

### Linux Usage (Precompiled Binary, Recommended)
On Linux, we provide a `koboldcpp-linux-x64-cuda1150` PyInstaller prebuilt binary on the **[releases](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases/latest)** page for modern systems. Simply download and run the binary.

Alternatively, you can also install koboldcpp to the current directory by running the following terminal command:
```
curl -fLo koboldcpp https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/releases/latest/download/koboldcpp-linux-x64-cuda1150 && chmod +x koboldcpp
```
After running this command you can launch Koboldcpp from the current directory using `./koboldcpp` in the terminal (for CLI usage, run with `--help`).


### Linux Usage (koboldcpp.sh automated compiler script)
when you can't use the precompiled binary directly, we provide an automated build script which uses conda to obtain all dependencies, and generates (from source) a ready-to-use a pyinstaller binary for linux users. Simply execute the build script with `./koboldcpp.sh dist` and run the generated binary. (Not recomended for systems that already have an existing installation of conda. Dependencies: curl, bzip2)

```
./koboldcpp.sh # This launches the GUI for easy configuration and launching (X11 required).
./koboldcpp.sh --help # List all available terminal commands for using Koboldcpp, you can use koboldcpp.sh the same way as our python script and binaries.
./koboldcpp.sh rebuild # Automatically generates a new conda runtime and compiles a fresh copy of the libraries. Do this after updating Koboldcpp to keep everything functional.
./koboldcpp.sh dist # Generate your own precompiled binary (Due to the nature of Linux compiling these will only work on distributions equal or newer than your own.)
```

## OSX and Linux Manual Compiling
- Otherwise, you will have to compile your binaries from source. A makefile is provided, simply run `make`.
- If you want you can also link your own install of OpenBLAS manually with `make LLAMA_OPENBLAS=1`
- If you want you can also link your own install of CLBlast manually with `make LLAMA_CLBLAST=1`, for this you will need to obtain and link OpenCL and CLBlast libraries.
  - For Arch Linux: Install `cblas` `openblas` and `clblast`.
  - For Debian: Install `libclblast-dev` and `libopenblas-dev`.
- You can attempt a CuBLAS build with `LLAMA_CUBLAS=1`. You will need CUDA Toolkit installed. Some have also reported success with the CMake file, though that is more for windows.
- For a full featured build (all backends), do `make LLAMA_OPENBLAS=1 LLAMA_CLBLAST=1 LLAMA_CUBLAS=1 LLAMA_VULKAN=1`
- After all binaries are built, you can run the python script with the command `koboldcpp.py [ggml_model.bin] [port]`

- Note: Many OSX users have found that the using Accelerate is actually faster than OpenBLAS. To try, you may wish to run with `--noblas` and compare speeds.

### Arch Linux Packages
There are some community made AUR packages (Maintained by @AlpinDale) available: [CUBLAS](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/koboldcpp-cuda), and [HIPBLAS](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/koboldcpp-hipblas). They are intended for users with NVIDIA GPUs, and users with a supported AMD GPU. Note that these packages may be outdated, and it's probably better to use official KoboldCpp binaries.

## Compiling on Windows
- You're encouraged to use the .exe released, but if you want to compile your binaries from source at Windows, the easiest way is:
  - Use the latest release of w64devkit (https://github.com/skeeto/w64devkit). Be sure to use the "vanilla one", not i686 or other different stuff. If you try they will conflit with the precompiled libs!
  - Make sure you are using the w64devkit integrated terminal, then run 'make' at the KoboldCpp source folder. This will create the .dll files.
  - If you want to generate the .exe file, make sure you have the python module PyInstaller installed with pip ('pip install PyInstaller').
  - Run the script make_pyinstaller.bat at a regular terminal (or Windows Explorer).
  - The koboldcpp.exe file will be at your dist folder.
- If you wish to use your own version of the additional Windows libraries (OpenCL, CLBlast and OpenBLAS), you can do it with:
  - OpenCL - tested with https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK . If you wish to compile it, follow the repository instructions. You will need vcpkg.
  - CLBlast - tested with https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast . If you wish to compile it you will need to reference the OpenCL files. It will only generate the ".lib" file if you compile using MSVC.
  - OpenBLAS - tested with https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS .
  - Move the respectives .lib files to the /lib folder of your project, overwriting the older files.
  - Also, replace the existing versions of the corresponding .dll files located in the project directory root (e.g. libopenblas.dll).
  - You can attempt a CuBLAS build with using the provided CMake file with visual studio. If you use the CMake file to build, copy the `koboldcpp_cublas.dll` generated into the same directory as the `koboldcpp.py` file. If you are bundling executables, you may need to include CUDA dynamic libraries (such as `cublasLt64_11.dll` and `cublas64_11.dll`) in order for the executable to work correctly on a different PC.
  - Make the KoboldCPP project using the instructions above.

## Compiling on Android (Termux Installation)
- [Install and run Termux from F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/)
- Enter the command `termux-change-repo` and choose `Mirror by BFSU`
- Install dependencies with `pkg install wget git python` (plus any other missing packages)
- Install dependencies `apt install openssl` (if needed)
- Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp.git`
- Navigate to the koboldcpp folder `cd koboldcpp`
- Build the project `make`
- Grab a small GGUF model, such as `wget https://huggingface.co/concedo/KobbleTinyV2-1.1B-GGUF/resolve/main/KobbleTiny-Q4_K.gguf`
- Start the python server `python koboldcpp.py --model KobbleTiny-Q4_K.gguf`
- Connect to `http://localhost:5001` on your mobile browser
- If you encounter any errors, make sure your packages are up-to-date with `pkg up`
- GPU acceleration for Termux may be possible but I have not explored it. If you find a good cross-device solution, do share or PR it.

## AMD
- Please check out https://github.com/YellowRoseCx/koboldcpp-rocm

## Docker
- The official docker can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/koboldai/koboldcpp
- KoboldCpp also has a few unofficial third-party community created docker images. Feel free to try them out, but do not expect up-to-date support:
  - https://github.com/korewaChino/koboldCppDocker
  - https://github.com/noneabove1182/koboldcpp-docker
- If you're building your own docker, remember to set CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH or enable LLAMA_PORTABLE

## Questions and Help
- **First, please check out [The KoboldCpp FAQ and Knowledgebase](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki) which may already have answers to your questions! Also please search through past issues and discussions.**
- If you cannot find an answer, open an issue on this github, or find us on the [KoboldAI Discord](https://koboldai.org/discord).

## Considerations
- For Windows: No installation, single file executable, (It Just Works)
- Since v1.0.6, requires libopenblas, the prebuilt windows binaries are included in this repo. If not found, it will fall back to a mode without BLAS.
- Since v1.15, requires CLBlast if enabled, the prebuilt windows binaries are included in this repo. If not found, it will fall back to a mode without CLBlast.
- Since v1.33, you can set the context size to be above what the model supports officially. It does increases perplexity but should still work well below 4096 even on untuned models. (For GPT-NeoX, GPT-J, and LLAMA models) Customize this with `--ropeconfig`.
- Since v1.42, supports GGUF models for LLAMA and Falcon
- Since v1.55, lcuda paths on Linux are hardcoded and may require manual changes to the makefile if you do not use koboldcpp.sh for the compilation.
- Since v1.60, provides native image generation with StableDiffusion.cpp, you can load any SD1.5 or SDXL .safetensors model and it will provide an A1111 compatible API to use.
- **I plan to keep backwards compatibility with ALL past llama.cpp AND alpaca.cpp models**. But you are also encouraged to reconvert/update your models if possible for best results.

## License
- The original GGML library and llama.cpp by ggerganov are licensed under the MIT License
- However, Kobold Lite is licensed under the AGPL v3.0 License
- The other files are also under the AGPL v3.0 License unless otherwise stated

## Notes
- Generation delay scales linearly with original prompt length. If OpenBLAS is enabled then prompt ingestion becomes about 2-3x faster. This is automatic on windows, but will require linking on OSX and Linux. CLBlast speeds this up even further, and `--gpulayers` + `--useclblast` or `--usecublas` more so.
- I have heard of someone claiming a false AV positive report. The exe is a simple pyinstaller bundle that includes the necessary python scripts and dlls to run. If this still concerns you, you might wish to rebuild everything from source code using the makefile, and you can rebuild the exe yourself with pyinstaller by using `make_pyinstaller.bat`
- API documentation available at `/api` and https://lite.koboldai.net/koboldcpp_api
- Supported GGML models (Includes backward compatibility for older versions/legacy GGML models, though some newer features might be unavailable):
  - All up-to-date GGUF models are supported (Mistral/Mixtral/QWEN/Gemma and more)
  - LLAMA and LLAMA2 (LLaMA / Alpaca / GPT4All / Vicuna / Koala / Pygmalion 7B / Metharme 7B / WizardLM and many more)
  - GPT-2 / Cerebras
  - GPT-J
  - RWKV
  - GPT-NeoX / Pythia / StableLM / Dolly / RedPajama
  - MPT models
  - Falcon (GGUF only)
  - [Stable Diffusion and SDXL models](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp/wiki#can-i-generate-images-with-koboldcpp)


          ```bash
          make LLAMA_OPENBLAS=1
          ```

  - Using `CMake` on Linux:

      ```bash
      cmake -B build -DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS
      cmake --build build --config Release
      ```

- #### BLIS

  Check [BLIS.md](docs/BLIS.md) for more information.

- #### SYCL
  SYCL is a higher-level programming model to improve programming productivity on various hardware accelerators.

  llama.cpp based on SYCL is used to **support Intel GPU** (Data Center Max series, Flex series, Arc series, Built-in GPU and iGPU).

  For detailed info, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](README-sycl.md).

- #### Intel oneMKL
  Building through oneAPI compilers will make avx_vnni instruction set available for intel processors that do not support avx512 and avx512_vnni. Please note that this build config **does not support Intel GPU**. For Intel GPU support, please refer to [llama.cpp for SYCL](./README-sycl.md).

  - Using manual oneAPI installation:
    By default, `LLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR` is set to `Generic`, so if you already sourced intel environment script and assign `-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON` in cmake, the mkl version of Blas will automatically been selected. Otherwise please install oneAPI and follow the below steps:
      ```bash
      source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh # You can skip this step if  in oneapi-basekit docker image, only required for manual installation
      cmake -B build -DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=Intel10_64lp -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DLLAMA_NATIVE=ON
      cmake --build build --config Release
      ```

  - Using oneAPI docker image:
    If you do not want to source the environment vars and install oneAPI manually, you can also build the code using intel docker container: [oneAPI-basekit](https://hub.docker.com/r/intel/oneapi-basekit). Then, you can use the commands given above.

  Check [Optimizing and Running LLaMA2 on Intel® CPU](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/791610/optimizing-and-running-llama2-on-intel-cpu.html) for more information.

- #### CUDA

  This provides GPU acceleration using the CUDA cores of your Nvidia GPU. Make sure to have the CUDA toolkit installed. You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager (e.g. `apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit`) or from here: [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

  For Jetson user, if you have Jetson Orin, you can try this: [Offical Support](https://www.jetson-ai-lab.com/tutorial_text-generation.html). If you are using an old model(nano/TX2), need some additional operations before compiling.

  - Using `make`:
    ```bash
    make LLAMA_CUDA=1
    ```
  - Using `CMake`:

    ```bash
    cmake -B build -DLLAMA_CUDA=ON
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```

  The environment variable [`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#env-vars) can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used. The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance:

  | Option                         | Legal values           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
  |--------------------------------|------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | LLAMA_CUDA_FORCE_DMMV          | Boolean                | false   | Force the use of dequantization + matrix vector multiplication kernels instead of using kernels that do matrix vector multiplication on quantized data. By default the decision is made based on compute capability (MMVQ for 6.1/Pascal/GTX 1000 or higher). Does not affect k-quants. |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_DMMV_X              | Positive integer >= 32 | 32      | Number of values in x direction processed by the CUDA dequantization + matrix vector multiplication kernel per iteration. Increasing this value can improve performance on fast GPUs. Power of 2 heavily recommended. Does not affect k-quants.                                         |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_MMV_Y               | Positive integer       | 1       | Block size in y direction for the CUDA mul mat vec kernels. Increasing this value can improve performance on fast GPUs. Power of 2 recommended.                                                                                                                                         |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_F16                 | Boolean                | false   | If enabled, use half-precision floating point arithmetic for the CUDA dequantization + mul mat vec kernels and for the q4_1 and q5_1 matrix matrix multiplication kernels. Can improve performance on relatively recent GPUs.                                                           |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_KQUANTS_ITER        | 1 or 2                 | 2       | Number of values processed per iteration and per CUDA thread for Q2_K and Q6_K quantization formats. Setting this value to 1 can improve performance for slow GPUs.                                                                                                                     |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_PEER_MAX_BATCH_SIZE | Positive integer       | 128     | Maximum batch size for which to enable peer access between multiple GPUs. Peer access requires either Linux or NVLink. When using NVLink enabling peer access for larger batch sizes is potentially beneficial.                                                                         |

- #### hipBLAS

  This provides BLAS acceleration on HIP-supported AMD GPUs.
  Make sure to have ROCm installed.
  You can download it from your Linux distro's package manager or from here: [ROCm Quick Start (Linux)](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/install-on-linux/en/latest/tutorial/quick-start.html#rocm-install-quick).

  - Using `make`:
    ```bash
    make LLAMA_HIPBLAS=1
    ```
  - Using `CMake` for Linux (assuming a gfx1030-compatible AMD GPU):
    ```bash
    HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -R)" \
        cmake -S . -B build -DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        && cmake --build build --config Release -- -j 16
    ```
    On Linux it is also possible to use unified memory architecture (UMA) to share main memory between the CPU and integrated GPU by setting `-DLLAMA_HIP_UMA=ON`.
    However, this hurts performance for non-integrated GPUs (but enables working with integrated GPUs).

    Note that if you get the following error:
    ```
    clang: error: cannot find ROCm device library; provide its path via '--rocm-path' or '--rocm-device-lib-path', or pass '-nogpulib' to build without ROCm device library
    ```
    Try searching for a directory under `HIP_PATH` that contains the file
    `oclc_abi_version_400.bc`. Then, add the following to the start of the
    command: `HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found>`, so something
    like:
    ```bash
    HIPCXX="$(hipconfig -l)/clang" HIP_PATH="$(hipconfig -p)" \
    HIP_DEVICE_LIB_PATH=<directory-you-just-found> \
        cmake -S . -B build -DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=ON -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
        && cmake --build build -- -j 16
    ```

  - Using `make` (example for target gfx1030, build with 16 CPU threads):
    ```bash
    make -j16 LLAMA_HIPBLAS=1 LLAMA_HIP_UMA=1 AMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1030
    ```

  - Using `CMake` for Windows (using x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS, and assuming a gfx1100-compatible AMD GPU):
    ```bash
    set PATH=%HIP_PATH%\bin;%PATH%
    cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DAMDGPU_TARGETS=gfx1100 -DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=ON -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
    cmake --build build
    ```
    Make sure that `AMDGPU_TARGETS` is set to the GPU arch you want to compile for. The above example uses `gfx1100` that corresponds to Radeon RX 7900XTX/XT/GRE. You can find a list of targets [here](https://llvm.org/docs/AMDGPUUsage.html#processors)
    Find your gpu version string by matching the most significant version information from `rocminfo | grep gfx | head -1 | awk '{print $2}'` with the list of processors, e.g. `gfx1035` maps to `gfx1030`.


  The environment variable [`HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES`](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/understand/gpu_isolation.html#hip-visible-devices) can be used to specify which GPU(s) will be used.
  If your GPU is not officially supported you can use the environment variable [`HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION`] set to a similar GPU, for example 10.3.0 on RDNA2 (e.g. gfx1030, gfx1031, or gfx1035) or 11.0.0 on RDNA3.
  The following compilation options are also available to tweak performance (yes, they refer to CUDA, not HIP, because it uses the same code as the cuBLAS version above):

  | Option                  | Legal values           | Default | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
  |-------------------------|------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | LLAMA_CUDA_DMMV_X       | Positive integer >= 32 | 32      | Number of values in x direction processed by the HIP dequantization + matrix vector multiplication kernel per iteration. Increasing this value can improve performance on fast GPUs. Power of 2 heavily recommended. Does not affect k-quants. |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_MMV_Y        | Positive integer       | 1       | Block size in y direction for the HIP mul mat vec kernels. Increasing this value can improve performance on fast GPUs. Power of 2 recommended. Does not affect k-quants.                                                                       |
  | LLAMA_CUDA_KQUANTS_ITER | 1 or 2                 | 2       | Number of values processed per iteration and per HIP thread for Q2_K and Q6_K quantization formats. Setting this value to 1 can improve performance for slow GPUs.                                                                             |

- #### CLBlast

  OpenCL acceleration is provided by the matrix multiplication kernels from the [CLBlast](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast) project and custom kernels for ggml that can generate tokens on the GPU.

  You will need the [OpenCL SDK](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK).
    - For Ubuntu, Debian, and Fedora the packages `opencl-headers`, `ocl-icd` may be needed.

    - For Windows, a pre-built SDK is available on the [OpenCL Releases](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenCL-SDK/releases) page.

  ##### Installing CLBlast

  Pre-built CLBlast binaries may be found on the [CLBlast Releases](https://github.com/CNugteren/CLBlast/releases) page. For Unix variants, it may also be found in your operating system's packages.

  Linux packaging:
  Fedora Linux:
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install clblast
  ```

  Alternatively, they may be built from source.

  - <details>
    <summary>Windows:</summary>

      ```cmd
      set OPENCL_SDK_ROOT="C:/OpenCL-SDK-v2023.04.17-Win-x64"

      cmake --build build --config Release
      cmake --install build --prefix /some/path
      ```

      Where `/some/path` is where the built library will be installed (default is `/usr/local`).
    </details>

  ##### Building Llama with CLBlast

  - Build with make:
    ```sh
    make LLAMA_CLBLAST=1
    ```
  - CMake (Unix):
    ```sh
    cmake -B build -DLLAMA_CLBLAST=ON -DCLBlast_DIR=/some/path
    cmake --build build --config Release
    ```
  - CMake (Windows):
    ```cmd
    set CL_BLAST_CMAKE_PKG="C:/CLBlast/lib/cmake/CLBlast"
    git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp
    cd llama.cpp
    cmake -B build -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF -DLLAMA_CLBLAST=ON -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=%CL_BLAST_CMAKE_PKG% -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
    cmake --build build --config Release
    cmake --install build --prefix C:/LlamaCPP
    ```

  ##### Running Llama with CLBlast

  The CLBlast build supports `--gpu-layers|-ngl` like the CUDA version does.

  To select the correct platform (driver) and device (GPU), you can use the environment variables `GGML_OPENCL_PLATFORM` and `GGML_OPENCL_DEVICE`.
  The selection can be a number (starting from 0) or a text string to search:

  ```sh
  GGML_OPENCL_PLATFORM=1 ./main ...
  GGML_OPENCL_DEVICE=2 ./main ...
  GGML_OPENCL_PLATFORM=Intel ./main ...
  GGML_OPENCL_PLATFORM=AMD GGML_OPENCL_DEVICE=1 ./main ...
  ```

  The default behavior is to find the first GPU device, but when it is an integrated GPU on a laptop, for instance, the selectors are useful.
  Using the variables it is possible to select a CPU-based driver as well, if so desired.

  You can get a list of platforms and devices from the `clinfo -l` command, etc.

- #### Vulkan

  **With docker**:

  You don't need to install Vulkan SDK. It will be installed inside the container.

  ```sh
  # Build the image
  docker build -t llama-cpp-vulkan -f .devops/main-vulkan.Dockerfile .

  # Then, use it:
  docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/app:Z" --device /dev/dri/renderD128:/dev/dri/renderD128 --device /dev/dri/card1:/dev/dri/card1 llama-cpp-vulkan -m "/app/models/YOUR_MODEL_FILE" -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 400 -e -ngl 33
  ```

  **Without docker**:

  Firstly, you need to make sure you have installed [Vulkan SDK](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/doc/view/latest/linux/getting_started_ubuntu.html)

  For example, on Ubuntu 22.04 (jammy), use the command below:

  ```bash
  wget -qO - https://packages.lunarg.com/lunarg-signing-key-pub.asc | apt-key add -
  wget -qO /etc/apt/sources.list.d/lunarg-vulkan-jammy.list https://packages.lunarg.com/vulkan/lunarg-vulkan-jammy.list
  apt update -y
  apt-get install -y vulkan-sdk
  # To verify the installation, use the command below:
  vulkaninfo
  ```

  Alternatively your package manager might be able to provide the appropiate libraries. For example for Ubuntu 22.04 you can install `libvulkan-dev` instead.

  Then, build llama.cpp using the cmake command below:

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DLLAMA_VULKAN=1
  cmake --build build --config Release
  # Test the output binary (with "-ngl 33" to offload all layers to GPU)
  ./bin/main -m "PATH_TO_MODEL" -p "Hi you how are you" -n 50 -e -ngl 33 -t 4

  # You should see in the output, ggml_vulkan detected your GPU. For example:
  # ggml_vulkan: Using Intel(R) Graphics (ADL GT2) | uma: 1 | fp16: 1 | warp size: 32
  ```

### Prepare and Quantize

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the [GGUF-my-repo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ggml-org/gguf-my-repo) space on Hugging Face to quantise your model weights without any setup too. It is synced from `llama.cpp` main every 6 hours.

To obtain the official LLaMA 2 weights please see the <a href="#obtaining-and-using-the-facebook-llama-2-model">Obtaining and using the Facebook LLaMA 2 model</a> section. There is also a large selection of pre-quantized `gguf` models available on Hugging Face.

Note: `convert.py` does not support LLaMA 3, you can use `convert-hf-to-gguf.py` with LLaMA 3 downloaded from Hugging Face.

```bash
# obtain the official LLaMA model weights and place them in ./models
ls ./models
llama-2-7b tokenizer_checklist.chk tokenizer.model
# [Optional] for models using BPE tokenizers
ls ./models
<folder containing weights and tokenizer json> vocab.json
# [Optional] for PyTorch .bin models like Mistral-7B
ls ./models
<folder containing weights and tokenizer json>

# install Python dependencies
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# convert the model to ggml FP16 format
python3 convert.py models/mymodel/

# [Optional] for models using BPE tokenizers
python convert.py models/mymodel/ --vocab-type bpe

# quantize the model to 4-bits (using Q4_K_M method)
./quantize ./models/mymodel/ggml-model-f16.gguf ./models/mymodel/ggml-model-Q4_K_M.gguf Q4_K_M

# update the gguf filetype to current version if older version is now unsupported
./quantize ./models/mymodel/ggml-model-Q4_K_M.gguf ./models/mymodel/ggml-model-Q4_K_M-v2.gguf COPY
```

### Run the quantized model

```bash
# start inference on a gguf model
./main -m ./models/mymodel/ggml-model-Q4_K_M.gguf -n 128
```

When running the larger models, make sure you have enough disk space to store all the intermediate files.

### Running on Windows with prebuilt binaries

You will find prebuilt Windows binaries on the release page.

Simply download and extract the latest zip package of choice: (e.g. `llama-b1380-bin-win-avx2-x64.zip`)

From the unzipped folder, open a terminal/cmd window here and place a pre-converted `.gguf` model file. Test out the main example like so:

```
.\main -m llama-2-7b.Q4_0.gguf -n 128
```

### Memory/Disk Requirements

As the models are currently fully loaded into memory, you will need adequate disk space to save them and sufficient RAM to load them. At the moment, memory and disk requirements are the same.

| Model | Original size | Quantized size (Q4_0) |
|------:|--------------:|----------------------:|
|    7B |         13 GB |                3.9 GB |
|   13B |         24 GB |                7.8 GB |
|   30B |         60 GB |               19.5 GB |
|   65B |        120 GB |               38.5 GB |

### Quantization

Several quantization methods are supported. They differ in the resulting model disk size and inference speed.

### Perplexity (measuring model quality)

You can use the `perplexity` example to measure perplexity over a given prompt (lower perplexity is better).
For more information, see [https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/perplexity).

The perplexity measurements in table above are done against the `wikitext2` test dataset (https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/wikitext-2), with context length of 512.
The time per token is measured on a MacBook M1 Pro 32GB RAM using 4 and 8 threads.

#### How to run

1. Download/extract: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ggml-org/ci/resolve/main/wikitext-2-raw-v1.zip
2. Run `./perplexity -m models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -f wiki.test.raw`
3. Output:
```
perplexity : calculating perplexity over 655 chunks
24.43 seconds per pass - ETA 4.45 hours
[1]4.5970,[2]5.1807,[3]6.0382,...
```
And after 4.45 hours, you will have the final perplexity.

### Interactive mode

If you want a more ChatGPT-like experience, you can run in interactive mode by passing `-i` as a parameter.
In this mode, you can always interrupt generation by pressing Ctrl+C and entering one or more lines of text, which will be converted into tokens and appended to the current context. You can also specify a *reverse prompt* with the parameter `-r "reverse prompt string"`. This will result in user input being prompted whenever the exact tokens of the reverse prompt string are encountered in the generation. A typical use is to use a prompt that makes LLaMA emulate a chat between multiple users, say Alice and Bob, and pass `-r "Alice:"`.

Here is an example of a few-shot interaction, invoked with the command

```bash
# default arguments using a 7B model
./examples/chat.sh

# advanced chat with a 13B model
./examples/chat-13B.sh

# custom arguments using a 13B model
./main -m ./models/13B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -n 256 --repeat_penalty 1.0 --color -i -r "User:" -f prompts/chat-with-bob.txt
```

Note the use of `--color` to distinguish between user input and generated text. Other parameters are explained in more detail in the [README](examples/main/README.md) for the `main` example program.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1991296/224575029-2af3c7dc-5a65-4f64-a6bb-517a532aea38.png)

### Persistent Interaction

The prompt, user inputs, and model generations can be saved and resumed across calls to `./main` by leveraging `--prompt-cache` and `--prompt-cache-all`. The `./examples/chat-persistent.sh` script demonstrates this with support for long-running, resumable chat sessions. To use this example, you must provide a file to cache the initial chat prompt and a directory to save the chat session, and may optionally provide the same variables as `chat-13B.sh`. The same prompt cache can be reused for new chat sessions. Note that both prompt cache and chat directory are tied to the initial prompt (`PROMPT_TEMPLATE`) and the model file.

```bash
# Start a new chat
PROMPT_CACHE_FILE=chat.prompt.bin CHAT_SAVE_DIR=./chat/default ./examples/chat-persistent.sh

# Resume that chat
PROMPT_CACHE_FILE=chat.prompt.bin CHAT_SAVE_DIR=./chat/default ./examples/chat-persistent.sh

# Start a different chat with the same prompt/model
PROMPT_CACHE_FILE=chat.prompt.bin CHAT_SAVE_DIR=./chat/another ./examples/chat-persistent.sh

# Different prompt cache for different prompt/model
PROMPT_TEMPLATE=./prompts/chat-with-bob.txt PROMPT_CACHE_FILE=bob.prompt.bin \
    CHAT_SAVE_DIR=./chat/bob ./examples/chat-persistent.sh
```

### Constrained output with grammars

`llama.cpp` supports grammars to constrain model output. For example, you can force the model to output JSON only:

```bash
./main -m ./models/13B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -n 256 --grammar-file grammars/json.gbnf -p 'Request: schedule a call at 8pm; Command:'
```

The `grammars/` folder contains a handful of sample grammars. To write your own, check out the [GBNF Guide](./grammars/README.md).

For authoring more complex JSON grammars, you can also check out https://grammar.intrinsiclabs.ai/, a browser app that lets you write TypeScript interfaces which it compiles to GBNF grammars that you can save for local use. Note that the app is built and maintained by members of the community, please file any issues or FRs on [its repo](http://github.com/intrinsiclabsai/gbnfgen) and not this one.

### Instruct mode

1. First, download and place the `ggml` model into the `./models` folder
2. Run the `main` tool like this:

```
./examples/alpaca.sh
```

Sample run:

```
== Running in interactive mode. ==
 - Press Ctrl+C to interject at any time.
 - Press Return to return control to LLaMA.
 - If you want to submit another line, end your input in '\'.

 Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.

### Obtaining and using the Facebook LLaMA 2 model

- Refer to [Facebook's LLaMA download page](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/) if you want to access the model data.
- Alternatively, if you want to save time and space, you can download already converted and quantized models from [TheBloke](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke), including:
  - [LLaMA 2 7B base](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-GGUF)
  - [LLaMA 2 13B base](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-GGUF)

### Seminal papers and background on the models

If your issue is with model generation quality, then please at least scan the following links and papers to understand the limitations of LLaMA models. This is especially important when choosing an appropriate model size and appreciating both the significant and subtle differences between LLaMA models and ChatGPT:
- LLaMA:
    - [Introducing LLaMA: A foundational, 65-billion-parameter large language model](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/large-language-model-llama-meta-ai/)
    - [LLaMA: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971)
- GPT-3
    - [Language Models are Few-Shot Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.14165)

    - [Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155)

### Android

#### Build on Android using Termux
[Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#installation) is a method to execute `llama.cpp` on an Android device (no root required).
```
apt update && apt upgrade -y
apt install git make cmake
```

It's recommended to move your model inside the `~/` directory for best performance:
```
cd storage/downloads
mv model.gguf ~/
```

[Get the code](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#get-the-code) & [follow the Linux build instructions](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp#build) to build `llama.cpp`.

#### Building the Project using Android NDK
Obtain the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk) and then build with CMake.

Execute the following commands on your computer to avoid downloading the NDK to your mobile. Alternatively, you can also do this in Termux:
```
$ mkdir build-android
$ cd build-android
$ export NDK=<your_ndk_directory>
$ cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$NDK/build/cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a -DANDROID_PLATFORM=android-23 -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-march=armv8.4a+dotprod ..
$ make
```

Install [termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app#installation) on your device and run `termux-setup-storage` to get access to your SD card (if Android 11+ then run the command twice).

Finally, copy these built `llama` binaries and the model file to your device storage. Because the file permissions in the Android sdcard cannot be changed, you can copy the executable files to the `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/bin` path, and then execute the following commands in Termux to add executable permission:

(Assumed that you have pushed the built executable files to the /sdcard/llama.cpp/bin path using `adb push`)
```
$cp -r /sdcard/llama.cpp/bin /data/data/com.termux/files/home/
$cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/bin
$chmod +x ./*
```

Download model [llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7B-Chat-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf), and push it to `/sdcard/llama.cpp/`, then move it to `/data/data/com.termux/files/home/model/`

```
$mv /sdcard/llama.cpp/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf /data/data/com.termux/files/home/model/
```

Now, you can start chatting:
```
$cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/bin
$./main -m ../model/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_K_M.gguf -n 128 -cml
```

Here's a demo of an interactive session running on Pixel 5 phone:

### Docker

#### Prerequisites
* Docker must be installed and running on your system.
* Create a folder to store big models & intermediate files (ex. /llama/models)

#### Images
We have three Docker images available for this project:

1. `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full`: This image includes both the main executable file and the tools to convert LLaMA models into ggml and convert into 4-bit quantization. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)
2. `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light`: This image only includes the main executable file. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)
3. `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:server`: This image only includes the server executable file. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)

Additionally, there the following images, similar to the above:

- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full-cuda`: Same as `full` but compiled with CUDA support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`)
- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light-cuda`: Same as `light` but compiled with CUDA support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`)
- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:server-cuda`: Same as `server` but compiled with CUDA support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`)
- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full-rocm`: Same as `full` but compiled with ROCm support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)
- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light-rocm`: Same as `light` but compiled with ROCm support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)
- `ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:server-rocm`: Same as `server` but compiled with ROCm support. (platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`)

The GPU enabled images are not currently tested by CI beyond being built. They are not built with any variation from the ones in the Dockerfiles defined in [.devops/](.devops/) and the GitHub Action defined in [.github/workflows/docker.yml](.github/workflows/docker.yml). If you need different settings (for example, a different CUDA or ROCm library, you'll need to build the images locally for now).

#### Usage

The easiest way to download the models, convert them to ggml and optimize them is with the --all-in-one command which includes the full docker image.

Replace `/path/to/models` below with the actual path where you downloaded the models.

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full --all-in-one "/models/" 7B
```

On completion, you are ready to play!

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:full --run -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512
```

or with a light image:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/models:/models ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:light -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512
```

or with a server image:

```bash
docker run -v /path/to/models:/models -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/ggerganov/llama.cpp:server -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0 -n 512

### Docker With CUDA

Assuming one has the [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-container-toolkit) properly installed on Linux, or is using a GPU enabled cloud, `cuBLAS` should be accessible inside the container.

#### Building Locally

```bash
docker build -t local/llama.cpp:full-cuda -f .devops/full-cuda.Dockerfile .
docker build -t local/llama.cpp:light-cuda -f .devops/main-cuda.Dockerfile .
docker build -t local/llama.cpp:server-cuda -f .devops/server-cuda.Dockerfile .
```

You may want to pass in some different `ARGS`, depending on the CUDA environment supported by your container host, as well as the GPU architecture.

The defaults are:

- `CUDA_VERSION` set to `11.7.1`
- `CUDA_DOCKER_ARCH` set to `all`

The resulting images, are essentially the same as the non-CUDA images:

1. `local/llama.cpp:full-cuda`: This image includes both the main executable file and the tools to convert LLaMA models into ggml and convert into 4-bit quantization.
2. `local/llama.cpp:light-cuda`: This image only includes the main executable file.
3. `local/llama.cpp:server-cuda`: This image only includes the server executable file.

#### Usage

After building locally, Usage is similar to the non-CUDA examples, but you'll need to add the `--gpus` flag. You will also want to use the `--n-gpu-layers` flag.

```bash
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/models:/models local/llama.cpp:full-cuda --run -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512 --n-gpu-layers 1
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/models:/models local/llama.cpp:light-cuda -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf -p "Building a website can be done in 10 simple steps:" -n 512 --n-gpu-layers 1
docker run --gpus all -v /path/to/models:/models local/llama.cpp:server-cuda -m /models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.gguf --port 8000 --host 0.0.0.0 -n 512 --n-gpu-layers 1
```

### Coding guidelines

- Avoid adding third-party dependencies, extra files, extra headers, etc.
- Always consider cross-compatibility with other operating systems and architectures
- Avoid fancy looking modern STL constructs, use basic `for` loops, avoid templates, keep it simple
- There are no strict rules for the code style, but try to follow the patterns in the code (indentation, spaces, etc.). Vertical alignment makes things more readable and easier to batch edit
- Clean-up any trailing whitespaces, use 4 spaces for indentation, brackets on the same line, `void * ptr`, `int & a`
- See [good first issues](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for tasks suitable for first contributions
- Tensors store data in row-major order. We refer to dimension 0 as columns, 1 as rows, 2 as matrices
- Matrix multiplication is unconventional: [`C = ggml_mul_mat(ctx, A, B)`](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/880e352277fc017df4d5794f0c21c44e1eae2b84/ggml.h#L1058-L1064) means $C^T = A B^T \Leftrightarrow C = B A^T.$
